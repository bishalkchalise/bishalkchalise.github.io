    Blueprints of Bias: Partisan Politics in Post-Disaster Housing Reconstruction

  </div>

  <div class="paper-details">
Partisan bias favouring local politicians aligned with the ruling national party can result in the misallocation of public resources. We examine how such bias operates when institutional safeguards are in place, focusing on disaster recovery allocation in Nepal. Utilising a close-election regression discontinuity design and administrative data covering the entire population of nearly a million beneficiary households and 2.3 million grant payments from an earthquake housing reconstruction program, we demonstrate that ruling-party-aligned local politicians enroll up to 36 percent more beneficiaries, with additional enrollments concentrated in poor rural regions and areas most severely damaged by the earthquake. Higher enrollment operates primarily through a grievance redressal mechanism in which ruling areas registering significantly more applications reflecting higher constituent expectations. However, identical acceptance rates across political affiliations indicate that ruling politicians respond to greater demand without bending program rules. Despite evidence of strategic targeting, this partisan advantage yields no measurable electoral returns.          </div>

            Political boundaries, as human artifacts, could shape deep-rooted social behaviors and identities. I utilise the merger of municipality boundaries that exogenously altered the ethnic divisions to examine the effect on social tension and conflict events. I find that areas with change in ethnic diversity, measured with polarisation, saw increased instances of violence post-merger by as much as 100 percent and take a U-shape, meaning violence subdues after few years. However, areas with strong social networks witnessed reduced conflicts by as much as 5–20 percent. The paper provides suggestive evidence that alternative social platforms that transcend ethnic groups and provide common economic benefits might be instrumental in moderating ethnic tension and fostering peace.

    International Migration and Structural Transformation
    <span class="coauthor-inline">(with Mushfiq Mobarak)</span>

    <span class="coauthor">Abstract</span>
  </div>

  <div class="paper-details">
    This paper examines international labour migration as a driver of local structural transformation through its effects on remittances flow to migrant-sending economies. Using a shift–share instrumental variable design that combines historical municipality-level migration exposure with destination-country exchange rate fluctuations, we identify that favourable exchange rate shocks increase remittance inflows by up to 21 percent, leading to improved household living standards through asset accumulation and access to modern amenities. These gains coincide with reduced household engagement in agricultural practices and substantial labour reallocation towards the service sector. Municipalities with higher migration exposure exhibit greater enterprise presence, especially in non-tradable service sector. However, this expansion appears driven primarily by remittance-induced consumption demand rather than productivity improvements. The findings suggest that while remittances enhance household welfare, they do not necessarily boost local productive capacity, underscoring the limits of remittances' long-term transformational role.

          <div class="paper-details"><span class="coauthor">Abstract</span></div>
          <div class="paper-details">
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telemedicine, significantly transforming healthcare delivery, financing, and market dynamics in primary care. While prior research has focused on the effects of telemedicine on access and quality, this study addresses a critical gap by examining its impact on general practitioners' (GPs) financial outcomes in a system with unregulated pricing. Using detailed GPs survey data, the study employs an instrumental variables approach, leveraging Google mobility data to account for endogenous telemedicine adoption. We find that telemedicine uptake does not alter the volume of services provided but leads to higher fees for both face-to-face and telemedicine consultations. While increased face-to-face costs are largely borne by patients through higher out-of-pocket expenses, telemedicine price increases are primarily subsidised by the government. This provide suggestive evidence that telemedicine adoption reshapes economic dynamics in primary care, driving higher prices without clear improvements in quality or access.

Developing countries sign DTA with the goal of attracting foreign investment, even at the cost of foregone tax revenue. But does that trade-off work in favour of those countries? This paper revisits the question by leveraging granular data on annual investment inflows from 90 countries to Nepal over the period 1990–2020 and a recent causal identification strategy. Using a Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) approach within a staggered adoption framework, we exploit variation in the timing of DTA implementations and the presence of FDI from non-DTA countries. Our estimates suggests no meaningful difference in FDI between countries with and without DTAs. Furthermore, a sector-specific assessment of foregone tax revenue from the airline industry indicates that Nepal loses approximately NRs. 635 million (US\$5 million) annually due to DTA provisions.          </div>
